This is my personal website. I released <a href="http://clwproductions.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/" target="_blank">version 1</a> about a year and some months ago. If you're interested in some more details on how that site came to be and the process of it's construction head over to my blog and check out the post titled, <a href="https://clwproductions.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/html-css-and-javascript-oh-my/" target="_blank">'HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Oh my!'</a>.

I've recently (within the past few months) released <a href="http://www.clwproductions.com" target="_blank">version 2</a>  and (in my opinion) made some pretty nifty changes. If your interested in hearing more details about this versions thought processes and construction again you can head over to my blog and check out the posts <a href="https://clwproductions.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/would-you-like-some-grunt-with-that-foundation-pt-i/" target="_blank">'"Would you like some Grunt with that Foundation? Pt. I'</a> and  <a href="https://clwproductions.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/would-you-like-some-grunt-with-that-foundation-pt-ii/" target="_blank">'"Would you like some Grunt with that Foundation? Pt. II'</a> respectively. 

I'm hoping to do my sites next version within the next couple of months to correct some of the glaring flaws that are in version 2. Particularly my JS file. I would like to move over to using OO practices and potentially move to vanilla JS (in order to learn some new stuff as I now know the jQuery library fairly well). 

If you have any comments, crtiques, or suggestions please let me know!
